Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project has three goals:

1. Provide build files for a (cross-) toolchain in order to compile Ada 
   for the NXT Lego-Brick and allow to upload and run programs based on the 
   Ravenscar-profile from a Linux system (x86_64, recent kernel).

2. Create a general framework for motion controlling and sequencing tasks
   written in Ada and using PNML (or UML Stateflow).

3. Based on this framework the creation of a Lego-Cleaning Robot.

Progress
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Toolchain and Tools
Based on the work of Luke A. Guest & David Rees (1) and Arch-Linux packages
for the arm-elf target (2), I've created PKGBUILD-files and a patch for a 
toolchain supporting Ada for a arm-none-eabi target

Done for Arch-Linux, they might be helpful creating your own toolchain.

binutils 2.22
newlib   1.20
gcc-core 4.6.1 (stage 1 or base compiler)
gcc      4.6.1 (patched)
gdb      7.4

Also a package PKGBUILD for the Ravenscar-Runtime provided by AdaCore (3)
for Linux is in the "other" folder.
The Package downloads the required sources from AdaCore and compiles the
Ravenscar Runtime System using the arm-none-eabi-toolchain.

Together with the libnxt (4) project the toolbox for sucessfully creating
and running Ada programms on the NXT should be complete.
The tool required some patching to run at all on new linux kernels, so I added
besides creating a package with patches, I forked an existing git-rep (5) to apply
the patches.

Finally samba_run proved to be the tool (with a patch from libnxt applied) to
load AND run Ada programs on the NXT Mindstorms Brick.

=> The basic_test program compiles and runs on the NXT

# cd demos/basic_tests 
# make all 
// Attach the NXT in Firmware mode
# samba_run tests


2. Ada-Control Framework
A lot of plans so far...


3. The Lego-Cleaning-Bot "C3-LegO"
Inspired by iRobots Roombas...
