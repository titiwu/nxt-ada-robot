To reflash the Lego firmware please follow the following steps:

1. Connect the device using the USB cable. You can verify the connection
by checking the /var/log/messages file for the message similar to the
following:

kernel: usb 5-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 13
kernel: usb 5-1: New USB device found, idVendor=0694, idProduct=0002
kernel: usb 5-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=0, Product=0, SerialNumber=1
kernel: usb 5-1: SerialNumber: 00xxxxxxxxxx

where xxxxxxxxxx is a device serial number.

2, Press and hold for at least 5 seconds the reset button hidden in the
pin hole under the USB port. You can check whether the device entered
reflash mode (a.k.a. SAMBA mode) by checking the /var/log/messages file for
the message similar to the following:

kernel: usb 5-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 10
kernel: usb 5-1: New USB device found, idVendor=03eb, idProduct=6124
kernel: usb 5-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=0, Product=0, SerialNumber=0

The device should also produce clicks in the speaker (about once per second).

3. Flash the firmware using the following command:

    su -c 'nxt-fwflash firmware-image'

where the firmware-image is the firmware file.

While flashing the output should be as following:
Checking firmware... OK.
NXT device in reset mode located and opened.
Starting firmware flash procedure now...
Firmware flash complete.
New firmware started!
